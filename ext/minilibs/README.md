Miniature libraries that consist of a single header and source file.

These libraries are in the public domain (or the equivalent where that is not possible).
You can do anything you want with them.
You have no legal obligation to do anything else, although I appreciate attribution.

- tree.c: Self balancing binary search tree.
- regexp.c: JavaScript compatible regular expressions.
- xml.c: XML parser and mini-DOM.
- xml.lua: XML parser in pure Lua.
